School project

Suggestion 1 - Claire Weber

For some small suggestions, both of these are on the editor page. I noticed at about 450px, the buttons along the bottom of the editor start to collide with and get clipped off by the margin, and continue to do so down to 150px (furthest I tested.)

Editor now goes in a 2x2 grid below 450px.

Suggestion 2 - Yairelys Perez Valdivia

I open it on my phone and the Panel and Store page, the Navigation menu are really small, maybe add some media query to fix this problem for small screens and to stack them vertically
